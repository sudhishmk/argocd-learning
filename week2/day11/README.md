# Week 2, Day 11: Progressive Delivery with Argo Rollouts (Revised)

---
## üß† Concept of the Day

While Argo CD is excellent at synchronizing your desired state from Git, it doesn't natively handle advanced deployment strategies like **Canary** or **Blue-Green** releases. For that, we use another tool from the Argo family: **Argo Rollouts**.

Argo Rollouts is a separate Kubernetes controller that provides a new Custom Resource called `Rollout`. A `Rollout` resource looks almost identical to a standard `Deployment` but includes a `strategy` block where you can define progressive delivery steps.

Argo CD's role is to sync the `Rollout` manifest from Git. Once that's applied, the Argo Rollouts controller takes over, executing the canary or blue-green strategy. Argo CD understands the health of `Rollout` resources and will show the application as `Progressing` until the rollout is fully complete and promoted.

---
## üíº Real-World Use Case

You're releasing a new version of a critical payment processing API. A standard rolling update is too risky as it could impact all users if there's a bug.

Instead, you use a `Rollout` object to perform a canary release. The strategy is defined to:
1.  Deploy the new version and send 5% of live traffic to it.
2.  Pause for 10 minutes while automated analysis checks Prometheus for an increase in error rates.
3.  If the analysis passes, gradually increase traffic to 100% over 20 minutes.
4.  If the analysis fails at any point, automatically roll back to the stable version.

This significantly reduces the risk (blast radius) of a bad release.

---
## üíª Code/Config Example

This `Rollout` manifest replaces a standard `Deployment`. It defines a simple canary strategy that pauses after sending 20% of traffic to the new version, requiring manual promotion to continue.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Rollout
metadata:
  name: my-app-rollout
spec:
  replicas: 5
  selector: # ... selector ...
  template: # ... pod template ...
  strategy:
    canary:
      steps:
      - setWeight: 20
      - pause: {} # Pauses indefinitely until manually promoted
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Daily Task

Today, you'll convert the `echo-frontend` `Deployment` managed by your Day 8 `ApplicationSet` into a `Rollout`.

1.  **Install Argo Rollouts Controller**: This is a one-time setup. The controller must be running in your cluster to manage `Rollout` resources.
    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace argo-rollouts
    kubectl apply -n argo-rollouts -f [https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/releases/latest/download/install.yaml](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/releases/latest/download/install.yaml)
    ```

2.  **Repo Setup**: Copy your work from Day 8 to a new directory for today's task.
    ```bash
    cp -r week2/day8/ week2/day11/
    ```

3.  **Convert Deployment to Rollout**: Since both `frontend-dev` and `frontend-staging` use the same `base`, you only need to change it in one place. Edit the `deployment.yaml` file located in `week2/day11/apps/frontend-dev/base/`.
    * Change `apiVersion: apps/v1` to `apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1`.
    * Change `kind: Deployment` to `kind: Rollout`.
    * Add the `strategy` block for a canary release.
    * rename the file to `rollout.yaml`
    * Your final file (which is now a Rollout manifest) should look like this:
        ```yaml
   
        apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Rollout
        metadata:
          name: echo-frontend
        spec:
          replicas: 1 # This will be patched by Kustomize
          selector:
            matchLabels:
              app: echo-frontend
          template:
            metadata:
              labels:
                app: echo-frontend
            spec:
              containers:
              - name: nginx
                image: nginx:1.25
                ports:
                - containerPort: 80
          strategy:
            canary:
              steps:
              - setWeight: 25
              - pause: { duration: 30s } # Pause for 30s then auto-promote
        ```

4.  **Update ApplicationSet and Sync**:
    * Modify your local `frontend-appset.yaml` (the one from Day 8) to point its `path` to the new `week2/day11/app/*` directory.
        ```yaml
        # In frontend-appset.yaml
        spec:
          generators:
          - git:
              # ...
              directories:
              - path: week2/day11/app/* # Update this path
          # ...
        ```
    * Apply the change: `kubectl apply -f frontend-appset.yaml`.
    * Commit and push your new `week2/day11` directory to Git.

5.  **Trigger and Observe the Rollout**:
    * To trigger a new rollout, go to `week2/day11/apps/frontend-dev/base/rollout.yaml` in your Git repo and change the nginx image tag (e.g., from `nginx:1.25` to `nginx:1.24`). Commit and push.
    * Watch the `frontend-dev` application in the Argo CD UI. They will change to `Progressing` and create new `ReplicaSets`. They will pause as defined in your strategy, then automatically promote and complete the sync.

### ü§î Daily Self-Assessment

**Question**: When you use Argo CD to manage an Argo Rollouts `Rollout` object, which controller is actually responsible for pausing the deployment, creating new `ReplicaSets`, and shifting traffic?

**Answer**: The **Argo Rollouts controller**. Argo CD's job is just to apply the `Rollout` manifest from Git; the specialized Rollouts controller then reads that resource and executes the progressive delivery strategy.
